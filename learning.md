# Mentra Learning Documentation

## What is Mentra?

Mentra is an AI-powered academic mentor designed to create personalized learning roadmaps for complex subjects. It helps learners navigate their educational journey by generating structured, prerequisite-aware paths that adapt to individual skills, goals, and time constraints.

## The Problem Mentra Solves

Traditional learning often involves inefficient paths through complex subjects, leading to frustration, wasted time, and incomplete understanding. Learners struggle with:
- Identifying the correct sequence of topics to study
- Understanding prerequisite knowledge requirements
- Balancing learning pace with real-world constraints
- Finding relevant resources for their specific needs

Mentra addresses these challenges by providing intelligent, adaptive learning roadmaps that guide users through subjects systematically and efficiently.

## Why Generative AI is Required

Generative AI is essential for Mentra because:
- It can dynamically analyze user skills and goals to create customized learning paths
- It reasons about complex prerequisite relationships between topics
- It generates explanations and motivations tailored to individual learners
- It can adapt roadmaps based on time constraints and learning pace
- It provides intelligent resource recommendations from vast knowledge bases

Without GenAI, creating such personalized, adaptive learning experiences would be impossible at scale.

## Planned Features

Mentra's roadmap includes several key features:

- **Roadmap Generation**: AI-powered creation of structured learning paths with weekly breakdowns
- **Prerequisite Reasoning**: Intelligent analysis of topic dependencies and sequencing
- **Motivation Layer**: Personalized encouragement and progress tracking
- **Smart Resources**: Curated recommendations for books, courses, videos, and practice materials based on user needs</content>
